# Grammar

## Top-level definitions

```
language -> { function | enum }

function -> [ "unsafe" ] "fn" identifier
              "(" [ variable { "," variable } [ "," ] ] ")" [ "->" type ] block

enum     -> "enum" identifier "{" variant "," { variant "," } "}"

variant  -> identifier [ "(" type { "," type } ")" ]

block    -> "{" { ( binding | expression [ ";" ] ) } "}"
```

## Statement

```
binding   -> "let" variable "=" expression ","

variable  -> pattern ":" type

type      -> "u8"
           | "usize"
           | "bool"
           | "char"
           | identifier
           | ( "&" [ "mut" ] | "*" "mut" ) type
```

## Expression

```
expression -> [ "return" [ expression ] ] | assignment

assignment -> comparison [ "=" assignment ]

comparison -> arithmetic [ ( "==" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" ) arithmetic ]

arithmetic -> term { ( "+" | "-" ) term }

term -> cast { ( "*" | "/" | "%" ) cast }

cast -> unary { "as" type }

unary -> [ "*" | ( "&" [ "mut" ] ) ] unary | factor

factor -> ( literal
| identifier
| call
| "(" expression ")"
| [ "unsafe" ] block
| if
| while
| match )
```

## Remaining Control Flow

```
if -> "if" expression block [ "else" [ if | block ] ]

while -> "while" expression block

match -> "match" expression "{" { arm } "}"

arm -> pattern "=>" expression ","

pattern -> literal
| [ "mut" ] identifier
| identifier "::" identifier [ "(" pattern { "," pattern } [ "," ] ")" ] )
| "\_"

call -> identifier "(" [ expression { "," expression } [ "," ] ] ")"
```

## Literals

```
literal -> integer | string | character | boolean

integer -> digit { digit }

string -> """ { printable_character } """

character -> "'" printable_character "'"

boolean -> "true" | "false"

digit -> "0" | ... | "9"

identifier -> ( letter | "_" ) { letter | digit | "_" }

letter -> "a" | ... | "z" | "A" | ... | "Z"
```

## TODO

- Currently, this grammar does not have any rules for anything related to `::`, use in
  - enum instances (e.g. `Token::Let`)
  - boostrapped functions (e.g. `std::mem::size_of`)

```
